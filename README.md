Hey everyone!

I'm excited to share my progress with you! I just completed the Tea Cozy project using Codeacademy's Challenge Project.

Here's what I learned:

Tailwind CSS: In this project, I learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS into my project.
Flexbox: This project helped me solidify my understanding of flexbox properties.
Check out my project!
